## Action 

Each of these actions cost one point of energy :

    Attacking with any one handed weapon : use focus to attack
    Attacking one time with any two handed weapon : use focus to attack
    Casting a spell : use focus de cast a spell
    Throwing a weapon
    Shooting with a light weapon
    Moving : move 10M
    Focusing : Gain 1 focus of your choice

Each of these actions cost two point of energy:

    Evading close combat without opportunity attacks
    Casting a level 4 or 5 spell
    Charging an enemy
    Attacking a second time with any two handed weapon : use focus to attack
    Focusing : Gain 1 focus of your choice (after the first)

## Concept : Focus

The focus is the core of each action , their  is five type of Focus , one for each characteristic :

    Brutality Focus
    Swiftness Focus
    Malice Focus
    Vitality Focus
    Spirit Focus

The max stored Focus is equal to his linked characteristic
For example if you have 10 in Brutality  you can store 10 Brutality Focus.
At each scene , each character replenish all his focus and at the beginning of a fight all character lose all his focus, gaining one point of each , each new turn. At level ten or higher character gain 2 focus per turn and 3 at level 20

### Consuming focus

While not in combat :

Each skill a player use will at least consume one Focus of his linked category. For each use a player have to set the level of Focus he want to use between 0 and his skill level . While 0 is Super Easy and 5 Super Hard .

### In battle:

Like not in battle, a player can use one of his skill to attack and set a level of difficulty to parry using an amount of Focus equal of the difficulty he want to set.

**Example** : _If Robert want to attack with a difficulty of Five he will have to spent 5 focus and 1 Energy (See : Energy)_

**Casting a spell** : Each component of a spell have a cost of Focus , and so a caster have to pay its cost plus the Energy (See: Spell)
Making a standart Skill roll like Perception or Intimidation but also parry or acrobatics!

→ About skill roll user can burn 2 different Focus to emulate his skill one level     higher, it can be done up to 2 level each time different can be used
    
## Concept : Difficulty level and Helping

Each action done while a skill is used have a difficulty the difficulty is set by those following rules 
:

    1°) The Complexity : (example : jumping 1M is easier than 3M )
    2°) The malus : (Example : running while having a leg broken
    3°) The environment : Example climbing while it’s raining

With those tool the GM can evaluate the difficulty of the action

 |   |   |   | 
 | - | - | - | 
 | 0  | Super easy  |  anyone can do it | 
1 | Easy  |  with a bit of focus you can do it | 
2 | Normal  |  With some skill you can | 
3 | Hard  |  You need to be skilled to do it | 
4 | Very hard  |  You need to a bit of help or be a master | 
5 | Epic  |  Doing that alone is a real challenge for a master | 
6 | Legendary  |  You need some help | 

If a DM want to had some rolls he can make the character put to test by rolling a D100 the threshold is calculated as bellow : 55- (difficulty *10) + (focus *10)
Helping 

Anyone can help someone doing a skill test , he can do a skill test too and giving half of his test as “Help”  to the one receiving the help .
 
## Concept : Spellcasting

## Creating a spell

A Spell is composed of a Form and any number of Effect.

Forms are a type of component , they define how a spell react (exemple : Projectile : create a magical projectile to the target ) if no form is defined all the effects are cast on the caster.

Effect , Up to seven Effects can be put on a spell , those effect must be known but can be mixed together even if there not of the same school or element : Example : Chill and Burn

## Casting a spell

A caster can only cast spell his school level allow him to pay in addition of one energy  :

    School Level 1 : 2 Focus
    School Level 2 : 3 Focus
    School Level 3 : 4 Focus
    School Level 4 : 5 Focus
    School Level 5 : 6 Focus

## Caster Weapons 

A caster should use a caster weapon to cast spell  because if he doesn’t do so he will get the following malus : 

    Spell range is reduced by 50%
    Spell duration is reduced by 25%
    Spell are 1 Focus easier to resist

All casters weapon can be found on the Equipment document.
